//Stack

//Bhavesh Mankar

//Stack is a data structure used for storing data in a order in which data arrives taken away is important


//insertion and deletion can be done in one end only

//Last on first out
//first in last out
//LIFO

//! Used in :
/*
* Balancing the bracket using stack
* Infix and postfix:
*  a+b --infix
*   ab+  --postfix
* evaaluation of postfix
* Implementatoin of calls (Recursion) 
* Page visisted history 
* Undo (sequence of text in a word file)
* Matching tag in html xml
* tree traversing  alogortihm 
*/

// !! Stack is an abstract data type '
// ? what is abstract data type ?
// *  abstract data type is a type for object whose behavior is defined by a set of VALUES and set of OPERATION.

//in abstract data type we are least interested in the implementation 
//We are not interested in how is it done.


//*  We can also consider it as a black box as it is doing the things that we wanted but we are not intereasted how it is done
// eg: integer is a abstract data type,

 // ! operation with stack ;

//POP : Removing an element from the top 
//PUSH : Inserting an element on the top of stack 
//top : top most element
//size : no of element in the stack
//isEmptyStack() , isFullStack() ;

// implementation of stack can be done by array or linkedlist
