 ***Graphs***

Types of graphs:
1)Directed(has arrow)  
2)Undirected graphs (dont have arrows)

**Grpahs has nodes
Horizontal line is know as edge 


**Cycles in a Grpahs
Start and end should be the same node in cyclic graph

Binary tree is also know as Graphs as it is not required for a graph to be circular

Path contains a lot of nodes and each of them is reachable


**Degree 
for Undirected Grpahs : number of edges attach to it

**Property of degree : total degree = 2*Number of edges.

Directed graph :: Indegree and Outdegree
Indegree:: incoming edges

Every edge will have weight but if not assigned then it will be unit weight ie. 1
