Time complexity :
Always consider worst case in mind in time complexity 



Iterations :
int x , int sum = 0 ; 
*****************
To find time complexity we need number of iterations
This time complexities like int x, int y ,int sum  are constat time complexities. they take O(1) time complexity.

eg : 
1)int x ;
int y ;
int z ;

Time complexity O(3);

2)while(n){
}
Time complexity O(n) ;

We always consider big time comeplxity: O(n) +O(1) == O(n) 

**********

O(n) +O(N) === O(N) ;

Constat time coplexities are alwyas said as O(1) ;

IMP:::::
Number of test cases will define number of iterations :::

10^7 to 10^8 iteration in online coding websites
10^8 iterations in 10 sec ;

** O(n) ;

for loops,while loops

Nested for loop O(n^NestedLoops)


**O (LogN) 
Good complexity ((Every coder should try to make O(N) to O(Log(N))))
while(n>0){
 n=n/2;
  count++ ;//to check number of iterations;
}
